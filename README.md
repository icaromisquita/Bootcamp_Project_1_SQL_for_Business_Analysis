WBS Coding School Project 01: Exploration of a real world dataset using MySQL
The aim of the project was to decide whether ENIAC (a European tech company specialised in Apple compatible accessories) should expand its business to the Brazilian market or not. As data analysts the task was to explore a publicly available, real life dataset (Magist) to answer questions based on data to make a recommendation to the board of directors.
