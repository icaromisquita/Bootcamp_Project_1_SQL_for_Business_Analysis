WBS Coding School Project 01: Exploration of a real world dataset using MySQL
The aim of the project was to decide whether ENIAC (a European tech company specialised in Apple compatible accessories) should expand its business to the Brazilian market or not. As data analysts our task was to explore a publicly available, real life dataset (Magist) to answer the business questions based on data and make a recommendation to the board of directors.

This repository contains the following files:

magist_code: the queries for exploring the data
data/magist_dump.sql: the data that can be loaded into MySQL
basic_sql_challenges.sql: A basic challenge used to learn and train my SQL knowledge
advanced_sql_challenges: A little more advanced challenge used further develop my SQL knowledge
